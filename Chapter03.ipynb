    "# Chapter 3: Constructing PDLs\n",
    "PDL variables are a new class of object within Perl. There are three main ways to construct them: via the pdl constructor; via one of the special index PDL constructors; or by reading in some external data. In addition, there are hooks for stuffing your own raw data into a PDL variable. The more basic constructors are here.\n",
    "## The basic constructor, pdl()\n",
    "The most basic way to make a PDL is with the function **pdl()**. You can feed pdl just about anything that makes sense: a perl scalar, a perl list, a nested perl list, another PDL, or even a perl list of PDLs. It will return an appropriately-dimensioned PDL containing those values. Here are some examples:"

    "**Boolean context** is what you get if you use a PDL in a branch statement like if or while or even the && and || operators. Multi-element PDLs are not allowed in this context, to avoid the confusion inherent in non-deterministic branching (&& and || are short-circuit operators that don't evaluate the second term if doing so would be redundant). Single-element PDLs are treated as TRUE if they are nonzero and FALSE if they are zero. (Note that the bitwise logical operators, such as & apply numeric, rather than boolean, context - so you can do elementwise Boolean arithmetic with &, |, and ^ - but not with &&, ||, and ^^.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Dataflow\" is the concept that multiple variables can remain connected to one another (so that data flows between them). PDL allows you to keep multiple variables that refer to the same underlying data. For example, if you  extract a subfield of a large data array you can pass it to subroutines and other expressions just like any other PDL, but changes will still propagate back to the large array unless you indicate otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, PDL's element-selection operators (such as slicing and indexing) maintain dataflow connections unless they are explicitly severed. To support dataflow, PDL has two different kinds of assignment: the global assignment operator = and the computed assignment operator .=.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global assignment is used to create new PDLs, and computed assignment is used to insert values into existing PDLs. Many other languages, such as FORTRAN and IDL, don't maintain dataflow for slices of arrays except in the special case where the slice operation is on the left-hand side of an assignment; in that case, those languages assume computed assignment rather than global assignment. That nuance sweeps under the rug the differences between the two types of assignment. It also yields many special cases that do not work correctly in those languages - for example, array subroutine parameters in IDL are passed by reference and can hence be used to change the original\n",
    "array - but array slices are copied before being passed, so the original array does not change. C sidesteps the issue by not (directly) supporting array slices. One result is that you can keep multiple representations of your data, and work on the representation that is most convenient. For example:"

    "\n",
    "Array languages like PDL perform basic operations by looping over an entire array, applying a simple operation to each element, row, or column of the array. This process is called **threading**. Threading is accomplished by the threading engine, which matches up the sizes of different variables and ensures that they \"fit\". The threading engine is based on constructs from linear algebra (but is slightly more forgiving than most math professors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most operations act on the first few dimensions of a PDL. These first dimensions are active dimensions and any dimensions after that are called thread dimensions. The active dimensions must match any requirements of the operator, and the thread dimensions are automatically looped over by the threading engine. The operator sets the number of active and thread dimensions. A given operator may have 0 active dimensions (e.g. addition, +), 1 active dimension (e.g. reduce operators like **sumover** and vector operators like **cross**), 2 active dimensions (e.g. matrix multiplication), or even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rearrange the way that an operator acts on a PDL by rearranging the dim list of that PDL, to bring dims down into the active position(s) for an operation or to bring them up to be threaded over. These rearrangements are a generalization of matrix transposition, though in general they are quite fast as they don't actually transpose the data in memory - only rearrange PDL's internal metadata that explain how the block of memory is to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threading rules\n",
    "\n",
    "PDL operators that act on two or more operands require the thread dimensions of each operand to match up. The threading engine follows these rules for each dim (starting with the 0 dim and iterating through to the highest dim in either operand):\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both operands have the dim and it has a size greater than 1 in each operand, then the size must be the same for both! **print pdl(1,2,3) * pdl(3,4)** doesn't work, because dim 0 of the left operand has size 3 and dim 0 of the right operand has size 2. **print pdl(1,2,3) * pdl(4,5,6)** prints the string [4 10 18].\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both operands have the dim and it has size 1 in at least one operand (it is a trivial dim), then the dim is \"extended\" as a dummy dimension. This is a generalization of scalar multiplication in linear algebra. **print pdl(1,2,3) * pdl(2)** prints the string [2 4 6].\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**transpose - matrix transposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "`$at=$a->transpose` will yield the transpose of a matrix `$a` (that is, with the 0 and 1 dims exchanged); you can use `$a->inplace->transpose` to change the variable itself.

    "\n",
    "You can generalize transpose to any two dims with xchg - just give the index numbers and those two indices get exchanged (transposed): `$at = $a->xchg(0,1)` is the same as using transpose, but you can also say (for example) `$ax = $a->xchg(0,3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mv - dim reshuffling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using mv shifts a dim from its original location to a new location; all the other dims stay in the same relative order but get shifted to make room and/or fill up the old slot. You can say, for example, `$b = $a->mv(3,0)` to move dimension 3 to the 0 slot. Afterward, `$b` will have the dimensions of $a in the order (3,0,1,2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**reorder - arbitrary redimensioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for carrying out many transpositions at once. You specify the order in which the old dimensions should appear in the new PDL: `$b=$a->reorder(3,0,1,2)` is the same as `$b=$a->mv(3,0)`, and `$at=$a->reorder(1,0)` does the same thing as `$at=$a->transpose`. You can reorder all the dimensions of your PDL or just the first few - if you ignore later dimensions they carried along \"for the ride\", keeping the same order in which they came.\n",
    "\n",
    "**flat - flatten a PDL**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat reduces a PDL of arbitrary dimension to one with a single long dimension. The 0 dimension runs fastest in the resulting 1-D PDL, and the last dimension runs slowest. For example, if `$a` is a 120x120 image then `$a->flat` is a 1-D array of 14400 values. That is useful, for example, for making a reduce operator (see Section [sub:Collapse-Operators]) work on a whole PDL at once. In the above example, `$a->average` would return a 120-array of row average brightnesses, but `$a->flat->average` would return the average brightness of the whole image (or, if `$a` had more dimensions) the average brightness of the whole collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**clump - flatten specific dims**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clump is useful for making an operation that normally works on one dimension work on more at once. For example, `$im->average` reduces an NxMx3 RGB image into a Mx3 array of row-average brightnesses. If you want the average brightness of each color throughout the whole image, you can say either `$im->average->average` or `$im->clump(2)->average`, to get a 3-array of average brightnesses for R, G, and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**reshape - allocate dims yourself**\n",
    "\n",
    "With reshape you can reassign the block of memory that makes up a PDL, cutting it up however you please. For example, if `$a` is a 60x60 image, you can say `$b=$a->reshape(100,36)` to create instead a 100x36 image. The product of the new dimensions should be less than or equal to the product of the old dimensions, or strange things may happen!"

    "Dummy dimensions are bookkeeping dimensions that act to the threading engine like complete dimensions but in fact repeat the same data in each position in the new dimension. A dummy dimension is simply a convenient bookkeeping convention; no extra memory is allocated for it. You create dummy dimensions with the dummy operator or via the slicing syntax explained elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dummy operator takes two parameters: a position at which the dummy dimension is to be inserted into the dim list, and a size. For example, if `$a` is a 100-array, then `$b=$a->dummy(0,50)`makes `$b` a 50x100 image - except that each column of `$b` points to the same piece of memory, so that assigning to any element of `$b` changes a whole row.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can \"physicalize\" a dummy dimension by making an explicit copy. For example, `$b=$a->dummy(0,50)->copy` makes `$b` a 50x100 image, each column of which happens to contain the same data, but in this case every pixel of `$b` is allocated separately from memory, so that assigning to `$b` works in the normal way.\n",

    "PDL contains many \"collapse operators\": enough of them that they deserve special attention as a group. A collapse operator has a single active dim. It summarizes elements along each row (the 0 dim) of a PDL, returning the summary of that row as a single number. Thus, a collapse operator will reduce a D-dimensional PDL to D-1 dimensions. The **average, sumover, and andover* operators are examples of collapse operators: each one has a single active dim and produces the average, sum, or logical AND (respectively) of everything along that dim of the argument PDL. To average over a dim other than the 0 dim, you must move that dim to the 0 position. For example, to convert a color image that is (NxMx3) to a black-and-white image that is (NxM) you can say `$bw=$rgb->mv(2,0)->average`. For historical reasons, some documentation refers to them as \"reduce operators\", because they reduce the dimensionality of their operands. "
