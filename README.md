# PDL Book in Jupyter Notebook with the IPerl kernel
 
I read two versions of PDL Books in the PDF format, i.e. PDL-Book-201202 and PDL-Book-201505. And I tried to convert and revise some chapters of the books into Jupyter Notebook with the IPerl kernel. The chapters then became interactive and attractive. The files correspond to the two PDL Books as the table below.

| Filename | PDL-Book version | Chapter |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Chapter01.ipynb | 201202 | Chapter 1 |
| Chapter02.ipynb | 201202 | Chapter 2 |
| Chapter03.ipynb | 201202 | Chapter 3 |
| Chapter04.ipynb | 201505 | Chapter 3 |
| Chapter05.ipynb | 201505 | Chapter 5 |
| Chapter06.ipynb | 201505 | Chapter 6 |
| Chapter07.ipynb | 201505 | Chapter 7 |
