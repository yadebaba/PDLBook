    "# Slicing, Dicing and Threading dims with PDL\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental to any vectorized data language such as PDL is the ability to manipulate subsets of data in convenient ways. PDL provides the facilities to change the size and dimensionality of data, to take contiguous and non-contiguous subsections of data along dimensions and to take completely arbitrary subsets of data meeting arbitrary criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key powerful feature is the ability to manipulate these subsets of data, and if desired to propagate these changes back to the original data **automatically**. This includes passing data to user-written subroutines, which may call standard external C code, which do not know or care about whether the data is a subset or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds pretty abstract - but here is a concrete example: with PDL one could for example select all the pixels in an image greater than a certain value or meeting some other condition. This might serve to isolate a bright star or galaxy. One could then pass the pixel values and their locations to a photometry subroutine (which is just written to work on data arrays not caring whether it is a subset or not) which would fit the pixels with some model and replace them in the array. These changed pixels would then be automatically changed in the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of abstraction is extremely powerful as it allows for very concise and clear code. We'll start by looking at the simplest operations to extract simple slices of piddles, and look at increasingly more complex kinds of slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding piddle dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDL data arrays can take arbitrary sizes and dimensions. Finding the current dimensions is straight-forward with the **dims** function which returns a list:"

    "Earlier we saw how to extract a rectangular subset of a piddle: `$section = $gal(337:357,178:198)`; The piddle $gal was a 2D image, we used array syntax (compliments of **PDL::NiceSlice**) to extract a contiguous subset ranging from pixel 337 to 357 along the first dimension, and 178 through 198 along the second. Behind the scenes, this is implemented by the **slice** function.\n",

The chief difference being that the argument to the slice method call is a string describing the elements to be selected. For the new **PDL::NiceSlice** syntax, you don't use the method or function call and the argument does not need to be wrapped up in a string.\n",

This means names (which can get in short supply) can be re-used for different objects.\n",

    "Slicing and indexing arbitrary subsets of data is certainly a fundamental aspect of any array processing language and PDL is no exception (as you can tell from the preceding examples). In PDL those functions might be even more important since they are absolutely vital in using PDL **threading**, the fast (and automagic) vectorized iteration of \"elementary operations\" over arbitrary slices of multidimensional data. First we have to explain what we mean by threading in the context of PDL, especially since the term **threading** already has a distinct meaning in computer science that only partly agrees with its usage within PDL. In the following we will explain the general use of PDL threading and highlight the close interplay with those slicing and dicing routines that you have just become familiar with (**slice**, **xchg**, **mv**, etc). But first things first: what is PDL threading?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading already has been working under the hood in many examples we have encountered in previous sections. It allows for fast processing of large amounts of data in a scripting language (such as perl). And just to be sure, PDL Threading is not the same as threading in the computer science sense or in the perl sense. Both concepts are related but more about that later.\n",

The advantage of threading will level off as the time for performing the elementary operation becomes comparable or even greater than that required to execute the explicit looping code.\n",

But finding such places and making use of these vectorized features is the key to using an array-oriented high level language like PDL successfully. This is what the programmer new to PDL and used to low-level programming has to learn: avoid explicit loops where possible and try to use automatically performed **thread loops** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is yet another benefit that comes with the threading approach. By looking at places where threading can be efficiently used you are also rethinking your problem in a way so that it can be very effectively parallelized! The keen reader has probably already observed that those internal automatic loops of elementary operations over subslices do not have to be performed sequentially. In fact, as of PDL-2.4.10, there is a new capability where PDL now **support automatic parallelization of the PDL threadloops via POSIX threads**:"

    "\n",
    "Having made the case for PDL threading let's study its own messy details. PDL threading is a powerful tool. And as usual you have to pay a price for power: complexity. The general rules for PDL threading can be confusing at first. But there is hope: you can first study the more simple cases and work up to more difficult examples as you go. So let's continue our tour of threading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question arises naturally: how can one find out about the dimension of subslices in a elementary operation of a function in PDL? We know from the preceding examples that some PDL functions work on a one-dimensional subvector of the data and generate a zero-dimensional result (a scalar) from each of the processed subslices, for example: **maximum**, **minimum**, **sumover**, **prodover**, etc. Two-dimensional convolution (**conv2d**), on the other hand, consumes a 2D subslice in an elementary operation. But how do we get this information in general for any given function? It is easy: you just have to check the function's **signature**!\n",
    "\n",
    "The signature is a string that contains this information in concise symbolic form: it names the parameters of a function and the dimensions of these parameters in an elementary operation. Additionally, it specifies which of these parameters are input parameters and which are output parameters. Finally, for some functions it contains information about special type conversions that are to be performed at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, you can find the signature of a function using the perldl online help system. Just type `sig <funcname>` at the command prompt, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    ">'pdl> sig maximum'<br />\n",
    "  Signature: maximum(a(n); [o]c())\n",
    "  \n",
    "The interesting part is the formal argument list in parentheses that follows the function name: **a(n)**; **[o]c()**. This signature states that **maximum** is a function with two arguments named **a** and **c**. Wait a minute: above it seemed that **maximum** only takes one argument and returns a result! The apparent contradiction is resolved by noting that the formal argument **c** is flagged with the **[o]** option identifying **c** is an output argument. This seems to suggest that we could maximum also call as **`maximum($im, $result)`**;\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in fact possible and an intended feature of PDL that is useful in tight loops where it helps to avoid unnecessary reallocation of variables (see below). In general, however, we will call functions in the usual way that can be written symbolically as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**`output_arg_list = function(input_arg_list)`**<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "or equivalently, using the method notation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**`output_arg_list = input_piddle_1->function(rest_of_arg_list)`**<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important information supplied by the signature is the dimensionality of each of these arguments in an elementary operation. Each formal parameter carries this information in a list of formal dimension identifiers enclosed in parentheses. So indeed **a(n)** marks a as a one-dimensional argument. Additionally, each dimension has a **named size** in a signature, in this example **n** . **c()** has an empty list of dimension sizes: it is declared to be zero-dimensional (a scalar).\n",
    "\n",
    "**If piddles that are supplied as runtime arguments to a function have more dimensions than specified for their respective formal arguments in the signature then these dimensions are treated by PDL as extra dimensions and lead to the operation being threaded over the appropriate subslices, just what we have seen in the simple examples above.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before a higher dimensional piddle can be viewed as an array (**again not in the perl array sense**) of lower dimensional subslices. Anybody who has ever worked with matrix algebra will be familiar with the concept. For some of the following examples it will be useful to illustrate this concept in somewhat more detail. Let's make a piddle first, a simple 3D piddle:"

We use one of the fundamental arithmetic operations in PDL, addition implemented by the \"\n",

Since similar situations occur very often when writing threaded PDL code the matching rules for extra dimensions allow a dimension size of 1 to match any other dimension size: it is the **elastic** dimension size in a sense that it grows in a thread loop as required. As in the thread loop the corresponding extra dimension is marched through all its positions (e.g. `slice(\":,($i)\" $i=0..n-1`) the elastic dimension just uses its one and only position 0 repeatedly (`slice(\":,(0)\") $i=0..n-1`). Therefore, an equivalent and more concise way to write the threaded multiplications makes use of this and the fact that a dummy dimension of size 1 is created by default if the second argument is omitted (see **help dummy**)."

However, as you get more experience with threading we strongly suspect that you don't need this any more; you will rather develop a much better \"feeling\" how to write down the right combination of dimension manipulations to achieve the desired result in a thread loop."
