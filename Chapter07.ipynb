    "# Graphics with PGPLOT\n",
    "\n",
    "A central requirement of any data analysis package is the possibility of visualization of data. PDL deals with this in a slightly different manner than some other packages in that no built-in graphics library is used, instead it uses other freely available external packages. In this chapter we will focus on the main 2D plotting package, PGPLOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will cover the use of the **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** package which uses the freely available PGPLOT subroutine package written by Tim Pearson. This is a very powerful package and **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** does not provide easy access to everything in the PGPLOT package, although it hopefully does most of what you will need.\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced use you might have to use some PGPLOT commands directly, see *Using PGPLOT commands directly* for a discussion of this. But even if you don't you are recommended to at least keep a copy of the PGPLOT documentation lying around. It is available from http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this section is to familiarize the reader with the PDL interface to PGPLOT and show how complicated datasets can be easily manipulated and displayed. The focus will be on interactive use to facilitate learning, but at the end we will turn to an object-oriented interface that might be more suited for scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** it is necessary to have the PGPLOT package installed, and in addition have the Perl PGPLOT module (written by Karl Glazebrook and available through CPAN) installed and working. In the following we will assume that you have this all set up."

    "## Introducing PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT\n",
    "\n",
    "2-dimensional graphics in PDL is normally performed by the **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** module. The **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** package must be used to give access to the commands. This introduction will be based on interactivity and use of **perldl**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**`pdl> use PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT;`**\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what you need to get running. We will now play around with a couple of commands before we turn to a systematic overview in the next two sections. We will concentrate on the **line** and **points** commands which draws continuous lines and individual plotting symbols respectively. The final result should look similar to Figure 7-1. ![Figure 7-1](./figure/7-1.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    ">**`pdl> dev('/xs')`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a large plot window on your screen, if you had some problems try to do **`dev('?')`** which will give you a list of available devices and allow you to choose one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to define a variable to have something to plot. The first plan is to simply plot a parabola and a Gaussian (bell) function as in the left panel in Figure 7-1, so we need an x-variable that is both positive and negative.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**`pdl> $x=zeroes(100)->xlinvals(-5, 5)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a 100 element piddle starting at -5 and ending at 5. We can then very easily draw a parabola:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**`pdl> line $x, $x*$x/12.5, {LINESTYLE=>'Dashed', Colour=>red}`**\n",
    "\n",
    "which should draw a nice parabola with a dashed red line. As should be clear the **line** command draws a line and takes the x and y coordinates of the points on the line as arguments and options to the command are given as an anonymous hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to plot a Gaussian on top of this, but if we were just to issue another plot command it would by default erase the screen, so instead we call the **hold** function to stop that from happening:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**`pdl> hold`**\n",

    "Again, note that the function **points** function plots symbols instead of lines. PGPLOT has a large array of symbols, normally accessed using numbers, but the most common have text aliases defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing left for us now is to ensure that the next plot will start afresh. Since we issued the **hold** command all subsequent plots will overplot the existing ones and since we do not want that anymore, we therefore have to **release** the device to the next set of plot commands:\n",

    "## An overview of 2D plotting commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to an overview of all commands in **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** it is necessary to define a couple of terms: The first is the concept of **device** - this is what the plotting commands work on, often this will be a screen device which shows resulting output on the screen in a window, but it can also be output to a file in some sort of format. Then inside each device there is a plotting area within which plotting commands gives a noticeable result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important concept is *holding* of plots. When a plot is held, any subsequent plot commands will plot on top of the existing plot. To explicitly hold a plot you issue the command **hold** and to release it again you use **release**.\n",

    "## Options in plot commands\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above and seen in the brief introduction to the PGPLOT interface earlier, we use options to modify the behavior of plot commands. Below we will often see examples of **specific** options, those that are only recognized by a particular plot command. However in addition there are **general** options that are recognized by many or all plot commands. These are normally the options you use most so it is important to know these.\n",

    "\n",
    "However due to the way they are implemented in the code (using the **PDL::Options** package) the hash is more flexible than normal Perl hashes. Firstly the options are **case-insensitive** and secondly some **have synonyms** defined so that for instance **Color** and **Colour** are both accepted to avoid bad feelings on one side of the Atlantic. Finally most, if not all, options **can be shortened** so that **Lines** will be interpreted as **LineStyle**. This is mostly useful when working on the **perldl**** command line however as it is error-prone in scripts (imagine that someone later implemented a Lines option which did something totally different, like draw 10 parallel lines, yeah, quite likely).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following listing of standard options is based on the on-line documentation which you can access yourself inside **perldl** as\n",

Are they to be displayed in several plot panels, are they to be plotted on top of each other, seamlessly plotted next to each other? But even more complex is the question of treatment of options and how to deal with these if there are less options than, for instance, lines to draw (a common occurrence if you wanted to draw a lot of lines).\n",

    "That said the **PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT** interface does have limited support for threading in the **line** and **points** functions. These call the **tline** and **tpoints** internally, and work just like **line** and **points** except that they expect the input y-piddle to be 2D, with each line in the array plotted against the x-piddle.\n",

    "## Recording and playing back plot commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever created a good-looking plot on the command line of an interactive data program, be it PDL, IDL, MATLAB, Octave or any other package, and wished that you could make a quick Postscript copy of it only to find that you need to redo all the commands? I certainly have. In the newer versions of PDL this is thankfully not the case anymore. These have a recording facility built in. However this is not enabled by default (for reasons described later in this section), you need to turn it on yourself. The way to do this is to set the **`$PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::RECORDING`** variable to a true value:\n",
    ">`pdl> $PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::RECORDING = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can turn this on automatically in the perldl shell if you put this command in your ~/.perldlrc file. Alternatively you can turn on recording for each plot device independently by setting the Recording option to true when starting a device:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`pdl> dev '/xs', {Recording => 1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you set the variable it must be set after you have use'd the PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT because this package sets the variable when it initializes to its default value of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following I will focus my attention on using the recording and playback functions in the perldl shell as I envisage that it will be most useful there. There are a couple of potential uses in scripts as well which I will get back to below, but this is not well thought through yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue it should also be added that the recording facility is somewhat experimental. In particular it doesn't deal very well with multi-panel plotting where you jump back and forth between panels. If you want to do that, make sure you specify the **Panel** option for every call.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to use the recording facilities with a few less obvious aspects. An example should go a long way to get you to understand the basics. First we set up a simple plot using the commands we learned above:\n",

    "The state contains references to the data plotted. This does not use memory (at least not appreciably!), but it does mean that an extra reference to the data is kept and the memory to the data might not be freed when you expect it to.

The best ways to avoid this problem in the perldl shell is to call the clear on the state: **perldl> $s->clear()** or to re-use the variable next time you call **retrieve_state**.

The problem with this is of course that one panel is updated a lot more often than the other so you have to waste a lot of time re-plotting the time-average.

Although hopefully they are not very common, it can be useful to look at a few to see what the PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT module doesn't do. Since it is possible to mix PGPLOT commands with the PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT commands this is not a major problem though, although it might require you to learn some PGPLOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to turn to some examples, I have decided to list a few simple problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Drawing several plot boxes on top of each other to get differently shaded grids. This is done in one of the demonstration programs that come with PGPLOT and can't be easily done in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT without some playing around with the PlotPosition option. It is a lot easier to call **pgbox** directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Complex contour plots - in particular non-rectangular. At present there is no support for non-rectangular contour plots in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT, and neither is any support planned for the near future. You are advised to read the PGPLOT documentation for **pgconx** and have a look at demo #3 in the PGPLOT distribution for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line is that as your plots get more and more complex you might end up in a situation where you need the finer control offered by the PGPLOT package, but for day-to-day use it is hoped that PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT will address most people's needs. And if doesn't then let us know!"
