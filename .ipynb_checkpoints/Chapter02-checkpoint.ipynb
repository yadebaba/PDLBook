It also allows command line recall and editing (via the arrow keys) on most systems. So we begin by running the pdl program from the system command line. On a Mac/UNIX/Linux system we would simply type **pdl** in a terminal window. On a Windows system we would type **pdl** in a command prompt window.

With these arguments it creates a 200 by 200 'radial' image. (Try '**imag(rvals(200,200))**' and you will see better what we mean!) **sin()** is the mathematical sine function, this already exists in perl but in the case of PDL is applied to all 40000 pixels at once, a topic we will come back to. The **imag()** function displays the image. You will see the syntax of perl/PDL is algebraic - by which we mean it is very similar to C and FORTRAN in how expressions are constructed.

PDL data arrays are special arrays which use a more efficient, compact storage than standard perl arrays (@a, @x, ...) and are much faster to access for numerical computations. To avoid confusion it is convenient to introduce a special name for them, we call them **piddles** (short for 'PDL variables') to distinguish them from ordinary Perl 'arrays', which are in fact really lists. We'll say more about this later.\n",

If you are calling more than one function it is however better to use some brackets so the meaning is clear. For the rules on this 'list operator' syntax see the Perl syntax documentation.
